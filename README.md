# future ideas/todos
## imp
find a better hosting service that is free and doesn't take _minutes_ to just appear when you enter the url. also we need to find a better url.

collect the names and faces and quotes and socials of everyone in the society and rebuild the team page, but also add a link to the old team page.<br>
after that, add a section like https://zed.dev/ on the main page with everyone's face

also have events older than one year get archived in a separate section, and have a "recent events" section on the main page

## maybe later
replace the background with some iconic image of NSUT (and add dynamic dither effect on top of that)?

use IBM font as main on newsletter, with georgia for headings. or just steal these fonts https://anytype.io/

make dither pattern even slower by 20%?

ask gpt to hallucinate event descriptions and get images from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-G3my0bNT35C-nrd7BWmGWjUDcww5SAI

reduce margins, increase font size

ambitious: have a script that checks our socials for new posts or the drive link for new folders and automatically adds them to the event section

allow switching from light theme to dark theme
