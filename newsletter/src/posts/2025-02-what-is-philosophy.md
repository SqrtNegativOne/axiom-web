We use the word constantly. We named our society after it, we cite philosophers in our WhatsApp arguments, we call it "the love of wisdom" when someone asks us to define it, and then we quietly move on, hoping no one asks a follow-up.

# ...but what the duck is philosophy?

The Wikipedia page on philosophy tells us the following.

> Philosophy (from Ancient Greek philosophía lit. 'love of wisdom') is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, knowledge, mind, reason, language, and value. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its methods and assumptions.

Good enough I guess. But could you *possibly* get any vaguer? What does it *feel* like to do philosophy? Why would anyone choose to spend a Tuesday evening doing it instead of literally anything else?

# A programming language for Attention

The editor believes a more applicable definition is to think of it as the theory, of Meta-ness.

We prepend the "meta-" prefix to all sorts of things — meta-ethics, meta-cognition, meta-philosophy. Even "metadata", "metatext", "metanarrative", "metacommunication", "metanalysis" etc. etc.. It means "about itself" or "beyond itself." Wikipedia defines it as "an adjective meaning 'more comprehensive' or 'transcending'."

Or, in short, when you strip bare the syllabi and formalisms, it is **the practice of refusing to let things go unexamined.**

Ever come out of a room and immediately forget why you went in there? Absentmindedly get your shoes before your socks? Open your phone to do something and start scrolling for no reason?

The human brain is a wonderful thing. Scientists only recently were able to estimate that we get (in the range of) a billion [Shannon bits of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(unit)) *every* second, while our conscious mind, the "speed limit" of our narrow light cone of attention in this vast universe, so to speak, is 10.[^1]

![Yeah](../berries.png)

Surprising to think that the brain even works despite this. And I am not referring to the ability to simply ignore 999,999,999 bits of information every second, that's pretty easy; you can do that just by killing yourself. What really begs the question is the fact that we can do what we can do, *despite* this.

> Mice can see, but they can’t understand seeing. You can understand seeing, and because of that, you can do things that mice cannot do. Take a moment to marvel at this, for it is indeed marvelous.
> Mice see, but they don’t know they have visual cortexes, so they can’t correct for optical illusions. A mouse lives in a mental world that includes cats, holes, cheese and mousetraps—but not mouse brains. Their camera does not take pictures of its own lens. But we, as humans, can look at a seemingly bizarre image, and realize that part of what we’re seeing is the lens itself. You don’t always have to believe your own eyes, but you have to realize that you have eyes—you must have distinct mental buckets for the map and the territory, for the senses and reality. Lest you think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal kingdom.[^2]

Philosophy is simply the application of this inner-muscle. The practice of noticing the scratches of the lens we see the world through. The practice of breaking out of autopilot, deleting inherited or borrowed assumptions, unquestioned habits of thought. The practice of choosing your own damn lenses, and then looking through them to see the world in a way that surprises you.

# What was the point of this, miss?

Every day people go about their lives. They go to work, write code, make money, have fun, fall in love, go to the dentist and so on. And they do it without wondering about the metaphysical nature of existence.

We are aware of the irony of philosophy society existing at a technical university. And the cliché of an arts professor yelling at clouds on how important the arts is and how engineers just want to make money, yeah, everyone knows it.

And if there is anything to learn from Peter Watt's seminal novel *Blindsight*, it's the fact that humans can lose against aliens with 0 metacognition. Novices prepare while experts... just do; Michael Phelps probably doesn't need to understand the Navier-Stokes equations to win. So why bother with philosophy?

# It's human.

We do it because we fucking can and because we have to. Once you get high on the supply of yet-elegant derivations of the structure of this universe, you're fucked. We are always doing philosophy. Even when you think you're not doing it you're doing it, so you might as well do it explicitly.

Every major decision in technology rests on a philosophical foundation:

1. **Should we build this?** (ethics)
2. **Who gets to decide?** (political philosophy)
3. **What does "better" mean here?** (value theory)
4. **Can we know if it's working?** (epistemology)
5. **Who counts as a person in this system?** (metaphysics of mind)

And as our world's greatest leaders in Artificial Intelligence race to make the Torture Nexus from the hit indie book "Don't Build the fucking Torture Nexus" you should think about this questions before you hear it from a Beer Biceps podcast.

# What We Do at Axiom

At Axiom, we don't pretend to have answers. What we have instead is a coterie of rag-tag communists mucking around in the campus, writhing in the mud of unsolvable questions. And sometimes, sometimes, we change some minds.

Maybe that's the true definition of philosophy. Mucking around.
