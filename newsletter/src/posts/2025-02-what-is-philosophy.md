We use the word constantly. We name societies after it, we cite philosophers in our WhatsApp arguments, we call it "the love of wisdom" when someone asks us to define it — and then we quietly move on, hoping no one asks a follow-up.

But what *is* philosophy, anyway?

## The Standard Answer (and Why It's Unsatisfying)

Philosophy, the textbooks tell us, is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It's the discipline that asks: *What can we know? What should we do? What is there?*

That's accurate enough. But it tells us very little about what doing philosophy actually *feels like*, or why anyone would choose to spend a Tuesday evening doing it instead of literally anything else.

## A Better Answer: Philosophy as a Practice of Attention

Here's what I think philosophy actually is, stripped of the syllabi: **it is the practice of refusing to let things go unexamined.**

> "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom." — Socrates

Most of us go through most of our days operating on autopilot — accepting inherited assumptions, borrowed frameworks, and unquestioned habits of thought. We believe things because we were told them. We value things because everyone around us values them. We see the world through lenses we didn't choose and can't quite describe.

Philosophy is the discipline of noticing the lenses.

## Why Engineers Especially Need It

There's a peculiar irony in the fact that Axiom exists at a technical university. Philosophy and engineering might seem like opposites — one deals in certainties, the other in questions; one builds things, the other takes things apart.

But this is exactly backwards.

### The Questions Underneath the Code

Every major decision in technology rests on a philosophical foundation:

1. **Should we build this?** (ethics)
2. **Who gets to decide?** (political philosophy)
3. **What does "better" mean here?** (value theory)
4. **Can we know if it's working?** (epistemology)
5. **Who counts as a person in this system?** (metaphysics of mind)

We don't usually frame them this way. But they're there, lurking beneath every product decision, every algorithmic choice, every line of policy.

An engineer who has never thought carefully about these questions is not just philosophically uneducated — they're *technically* incomplete.

## What We Do at Axiom

At Axiom, we don't pretend to have answers. What we have is a community willing to sit with questions — over chai, over essays, over long walks around campus.

We read things that challenge us. We argue, sometimes heatedly. We change our minds. Occasionally, we have a thought that surprises even ourselves.

That, in the end, might be the best definition of philosophy: *the practice of thinking thoughts that surprise you.*
